# Hottels-zone-modelling-example
This repository provides an example of how to model full scale industrial reheating furnaces using Hottel's zone method of radiation analysis. 
The The furnace studied has an effective length of 36 mand width of 10 m. The furnace height varies between 4.0 m and 4.7 m along the length of the furnace. 
In total 71 burners are installed within 6 control zones which fire low-heating-value (LHV: 8.73 MJ kg-1) mixed enhanced fuel gas with a typical stoichiometric air requirement of 2.21 kg air/kg fuel.
Please see article published on Applied Energy 173 (2016) 555â€“566 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.011), where the model I developed is detailed.
